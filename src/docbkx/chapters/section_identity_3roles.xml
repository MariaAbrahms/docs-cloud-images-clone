    <title>Role Based Access Control</title>
    <para> Role Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts access to the capabilities of Rackspace Cloud services, including the
        &CImA;, to authorized users only. RBAC enables Rackspace Cloud customers to specify which account users of their
        Cloud account have access to which &CImA; service capabilities, based on roles defined by Rackspace (see <olink
            targetdoc="ci-devguide" targetptr="RBAC_product_roles_table_3" xrefstyle="select:title">Table 2, “Cloud Images
            Product Roles and Permissions”</olink>). The permissions to perform certain operations in the &CImA; – create,
        read, update, delete – are assigned to specific roles. The account owner user assigns these roles, either global
        (multiproduct) or product-specific (for example, Cloud Images), to account users. </para>

        <title>Assigning Roles to Account Users</title>
        <para> The account owner (identity:user-admin) can create account users on the account and then assign roles to those
            users. The roles grant the account users specific permissions for accessing the capabilities of the &CImS;. Each
            account has only one account owner, and that role is assigned by default to any Rackspace Cloud account when the
            account is created. </para>

        <title>Resolving Conflicts Between RBAC Multiproduct vs. Custom Cloud Images Roles</title>
        <para> The account owner can set multiproduct roles and roles specifically for Cloud Images, and it is important to
            understand how any potential conflicts among these roles are resolved. When two roles appear to conflict, the
            role that provides the more extensive permissions takes precedence. Therefore, admin roles take precedence over
            observer and creator roles, because admin roles provide more permissions. </para>
