        <para>You can optionally integrate Glance with the
            OpenStack Identity Service project. Setting this up is
            relatively straightforward: the Identity Service distribution at
                <link

                >http://github.com/openstack/keystone</link> includes
            the requisite middleware and examples of appropriately
            modified glance-api.conf and glance-registry.conf
            configuration files in the examples/paste directory. Once
            you have installed Keystone and edited your configuration
            files, newly created images will have their owner
            attribute set to the tenant of the authenticated users,
            and the is_public attribute will cause access to those
            images for which it is false to be restricted to only the
            owner.</para>
        <para>The exception is those images for which owner is set to
            null, which may only be done by those users having the
            Admin role. These images may still be accessed by the
            public, but will not appear in the list of public images.
            This allows the Glance Registry owner to publish images
            for beta testing without allowing those images to show up
            in lists, potentially confusing users.</para>
        <para>It is possible to allow a private image to be shared
            with one or more alternate tenants. This is done through
            image memberships, which are available via the members
            resource of images. (For more details, see the next
            chapter.) Essentially, a membership is an association
            between an image and a tenant which has permission to
            access that image. These membership associations may also
            have a can_share attribute, which, if set to true,
            delegates the authority to share an image to the named
            tenant.</para>
