    <para>Images can be created and deleted by image producers, updated by image consumers, and listed by both image
        producers and image consumers.</para>
    <para>The producer shares an image with the consumer by making the consumer a <glossterm baseform="Image Member"
            >member</glossterm> of that image. The consumer then accepts or rejects the image by changing the member status.
        Once accepted, the image appears in the consumer's image list.</para>

                    <para>The consumer's image list may be filtered by status to see shared images in the various member
                        statuses. For example, the consumer can discover images that have been shared with him or her by
                        filtering on <code>visibility=shared&amp;member_status=pending</code>.</para>
