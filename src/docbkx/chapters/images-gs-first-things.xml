    <para>Before you get started using and sharing images, take a moment to review how to use API operations to send requests
        to and receive responses from Rackspace cloud services. Also, before you can use the &CImA;, you must first
        authenticate with the Rackspace cloud. This section shows you how to get an authentication token, which allows you to
        access the &CImS;. If you're already familiar with these activities and you have your authentication token, go to
        Getting Started.</para>
