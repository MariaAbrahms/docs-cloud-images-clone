    <para> Cloud Images brings access to the OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service directly to Rackspace open cloud
        customers, thereby providing services for discovering, registering, and retrieving virtual machine images and their
        metadata by using a RESTful API. </para>
    <para>Image <emphasis role="italics">sharing</emphasis> provides a mechanism for customers to give access to images in
        their account to other customers. Customer A initiates sharing with Customer B, and Customer B accepts the offer. The
        image is not copied into Customer B's repository, but Customer B has access to the image in Customer A's
        repository.</para>
    <para>Image <emphasis role="italics">import/export</emphasis> enables customers to import images into the Rackspace
        cloud. Customers upload the image to Cloud Files, and then they use the <emphasis role="italics">import</emphasis>
        feature to make it into a cloud image. They can store the cloud image in any Cloud Files location for future
        downloading.</para>
    <para>Cloud Images has the following expected benefits: <itemizedlist>
