                image member, linking the image and the consumer. Once an image is shared, the image is available for the
                consumer to use, regardless of image member status. Both producers and consumers can check the status of an
                image member.</p><p>Image member status both controls whether the image appears in the consumer's image list and lets the
                producer know whether the consumer acknowledges the offer. If the consumer wants the image to appear in the
                image list, the consumer accepts the image. Otherwise, the consumer rejects the image.</p><p/><p>If the image producer no longer wants the share an image with a consumer, the producer deletes the image
                member. Once the image member is deleted, the consumer cannot use the image, and the image is removed from
                the consumer's image list.</p><p>For more information on image sharing, see <span class="olink">“Image sharing”</span><span class="olink">“Image sharing”</span>.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="file:/Applications/oxygen/frameworks/docbook/xsl/images/tip.png"/></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Consumers and producers view the image status by using the instructions in <span class="olink">"GET_getImageMember_images__image_id__members__member_id__Image_Both_Calls"</span>
