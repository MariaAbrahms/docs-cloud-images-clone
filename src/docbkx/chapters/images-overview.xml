        <para>Server Images are used to store a snapshot of the server's configuration. If you take an image of the original
            server, you can create a new server from that image. The new server will be exactly the same as the original
            server at the time the image was created.</para>
        <para>The &CImS; provides operations that allow you to manipulate images, import and export images (using tasks), and
            to share images with other people.</para>
